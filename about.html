      <p id="information-paragraph">I am a freelance artist and IT student with experience and small background in creative design with Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop, After Effects, Illustrator), as well as in fashion and modelling. Currently studying and learning to be an IT professional with Data Science, Cybersecurity, programming experience and skills. I consider myself to be a leader and learner with never-ending curiosity, focused on fulfilling my goals and aspirations.<br><br>Being surrounded by technology and family members working in IT related fields, I became bound to be interested in learning and experiencing the vast amount of technology I am buried in. This ranges from the mechanical side of computers and their hardware, to the digital side of phones and their software.</p>

   <section id="hobbiesinterests">
      <p id="hobbiesinterests-paragraph">Fashion and Art have been my most invested hobbies for years as they have allowed me to express my feelings and creativity as much as I want. I wish to influence my audience to seek out for creativity and get out of their confort zones to try something new.<br><br>My passion for IT came about when I was 16 years old after realizing that this is what I wished to pursue. As I tend to be logical and analytical to balance my love for aesthetics, Mathematics and Science was something I was also greatly interested in. Being able to help people with my knowledge of IT is what I wish to achieve in the future with the profession I aspire to be in.</p>
